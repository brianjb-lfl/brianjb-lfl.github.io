      <h4>Forest and Trees: Dev Version</h4>
      <p>I've spent the past few weeks working through Thinkful's Prep Course and generally keeping myself fresh coding-wise, primarily in the areas of html, css and js.  To be honest, coming into this most of my programming experience lies elsewhere.  This sudden immersion into these areas has had me paying a lot more attention to the websites that I encounter in my daily travels.</p>
      <p>It seems that here in development, as almost anywhere else, one can lose the forest for the trees if they are not intentional in their efforts.  Really good sites reveal the soul of the person or organization they represent, and leave one with an unmistakable and unforgettable understanding of the subject's vision.
      </p>
      <p>Other sites say little more than, "Look at all the cool stuff our contractor can do with javascript."  Unless such a site is a developer's portfolio, it can go so wrong.  Lots of colors.  Moving things.  Flashing things.  Lots of fonts (including a heavy dose of Comic Sans).  Netscape called, and well, you know the rest.</p>
      <p>This is not to say that these tools are bad or unnecessary.  Obviously I'm about to invest my livelihood in this field.  It is good to have as many tools as possible from which to choose, assuming that one chooses wisely.  When I have a new hammer, the whole world looks like a nail.  Like anyone, I'm prone to this.  After I've learned a new trick, for a time, it will seem like every situation is a chance to employ what I've learned.
      </p>
      <p>I need to always remain vigilant to ensure that I don't muddy the message with superfluous demonstrations of my own prowess.</p>

      <h4>C-Change</h4>
      <p>36 hours from now I'll be taking the biggest leap of my life since joining the Navy.  That first one worked out pretty well, so I'm not scurred.  Currently I'm a licensed and successful CPA.  But, looking back I've realized that many of my highlights have involved developing and deploying technology to make like easier/better for my team and my organization.  So, for me it's off to BootCamp (<a href="https://www.thinkful.com/" target="_blank">Thinkful's Full-Time Web Developer BootCamp</a>) once again.</p>
